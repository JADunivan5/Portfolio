# Lightning Round.
## What was the most difficult part of the class for you?
- Learning all the different commands and functions inside of packages.
  - Why? This has been difficult because I can very much outline what I want to do when it comes to my project but its then coding it to work without any errors. As well as then combining multiple functions together to give me the desired output im looking for when it comes to graphical displays.
## Easiest part of the class for you? Explain why.
- Easiest part for me is pulling files from github into R.
  - Why? We have now been doing this for multiple weeks, it has become second nature for me to fork a repository and the start up R-studio and choose version control as a new project and get working right away. I used to have to look back at the steps but now I very much can do all of that and then when finished commit my changes and push them to github.

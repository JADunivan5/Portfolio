# Portfolio 
First thing up in my Portfolio here we will include the essay questions followed by the evidence and code to support it. Each Essay question will have its own read me document for convenience.
## Essay Question One 
 - Describe how you have improved as a practitioner and student of data person this semester through your work in the course. Focus specifically on statistical computing and graphics ideas and the methods we employed in learning them. Do not give a laundry list of topics that you learned (those are in the syllabus/weekly content area, so we know them already). Focus instead on a small number of specific areas of growth for you that happened in STA 418/518. Identify at least one artifact in your portfolio that illustrates each area of growth. Explain in this essay how this artifact shows growth in the way you are describing. 
## Essay Question Two
- To be determined...(not relevant for Midterm)
## Lightening Round 
 - What was the most difficult part of the class for you? List a general topic, a specific problem, a kind of work we did, etc. and explain why.
 - What was the easiest part of the class for you? Explain why 
 - What part of the class surprised or interested you the most? Explain why. 
 - Give one piece of advice to a student just beginning a semester of STA 418/518 that will help them be successful in learning.

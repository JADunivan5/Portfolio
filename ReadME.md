# Portfolio (Table of Contents)
First thing up in my Portfolio here we will include the essay questions followed by the evidence and code to support it. Each Essay question will have its own read me document for convenience. As will the final grade reflection.
## [Essay Question One](https://github.com/JADunivan5/Portfolio/blob/main/Essay%20Question%20One.md) 
 - Describe how you have improved as a practitioner and student of data person this semester through your work in the course. Focus specifically on statistical computing and graphics ideas and the methods we employed in learning them. Do not give a laundry list of topics that you learned (those are in the syllabus/weekly content area, so we know them already). Focus instead on a small number of specific areas of growth for you that happened in STA 418/518. Identify at least one artifact in your portfolio that illustrates each area of growth. Explain in this essay how this artifact shows growth in the way you are describing. 
## Essay Question Two
- To be determined...(not relevant for Midterm)
## [Lightning Round](https://github.com/JADunivan5/Portfolio/blob/main/Lightning%20Round.md)
 - What was the most difficult part of the class for you? List a general topic, a specific problem, a kind of work we did, etc. and explain why. 
 - What was the easiest part of the class for you? Explain why 
 - What part of the class surprised or interested you the most? Explain why. 
 - Give one piece of advice to a student just beginning a semester of STA 418/518 that will help them be successful in learning.
# Final Grade Reflection
1. What Grade Did You Earn? State it clearly in one sentence. You can include plus/minus modifiers; see below about those.
2. How Did You Demonstrate That Grade? Review the course objectives carefully (remember that we also have an ongoing list of subobjectives). Then, explain how you have demonstrated (point to specific examples and explain) each objective. Your discussion should explain why that work shows the grade you are saying you have earned. Be specific and thorough. List each main course objective (i.e., those listed in the syllabus) that you have met and how you know you have met it. Refer to specific artifacts or examples in your Portfolio that support your case. Again, keep it brief and focused on concrete evidence that the criteria have been met. This is not filing your taxes, so a precise down-to-the-minute accounting of your work is not necessary. Remember the purpose is to make a convincing case that you’ve earned a particular grade.
3. What Else? There may be some other criteria that figures into your grade request that is not explictly listed in the syllabus. If so, state the criteria you’re thinking of, explain why they are useful criteria for your grade determination, and then explain how well you met those criteria (and provide evidence in the artifacts, if applicable). As with the syllabus course objectives, be focused, specific, and thorough — and refer to specific artifacts that provide evidence.

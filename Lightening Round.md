# Lightening Round.
## What was the most difficult part of the class for you?
-Learning all the different commands and functions inside of packages.
 -Why? This has been difficult because I can very much outline what I want to do when it comes to my project but its then coding it to work without any errors and then combining multiple functions together to give me the desired output im looking for when it comes to graphical displays.

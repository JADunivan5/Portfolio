## Growth as a Data Person
- I feel that my growth as a data person as tremondously improved since starting this course. There have been many things that I thought would not have been possible but after being half way through this course. Focusing on statistical computing, graphic ideas and methods we have employed learning them. Firstly with statistical computing, we just learned how to build functions that make life easier when we have to repeat portions of code over and over. Next moving towards graphic methods, through my project this semester I have been exploring NFL data. Throughout this process it has been imperative to have graphical displays to under the data. For example, lightly explaining this process, I have been working to chart play types by occurences on the down they happen. Using the ggplot method I have been able to accomplish this so far, I would still like to explore other graphic models other than what I currently have. For the final part about the moethods we employed in learning them I would like to point towards the activities we work on during class, so a activity I found to be extremely heplful in my growth as a data person was our Denny's activity.

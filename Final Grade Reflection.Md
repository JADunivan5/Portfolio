#Final Grade Reflection
## 1. What Grade Did You Earn?
- Currently I would say I have met the grade requirements for a "B", with hopes of pushing that towards and "A"
## 2. How Did You Demonstrate That Grade?
- That grade I believe is currently demonstrated by the completion of 2 of the 5 course objectives, with 2 being a work in progress and 1 hoping to be accomplished later on in the class.
  - Starting with 2 that have been satisfied. We can look towards the NFL Project I am working on. This satisfied the objective of "Import, manage and clean data". This is completed in my project the dataset was succesfull imported, managed and cleaned. As well as taken step further by using the janitor package to give variable names cleaner names for better ease of use. Next this also satisfies the "Create graphical displays and numerical summaries of data for exploratory analysis and presentations.". One of the first things I attempeted to do was charting the play types by the down they happened on. This is still being refined further but I would say that it does satisfy the requirement. Here is example image of what has been done so far! ![alt text](MidtermImage.png "Title").
  - Now for the 2 that I feel are a work in progress. First objective that I feel is a work in progress would have to be the "Use source documentation and other resources to troubleshoot and extend R programs.". The reason I say that this one is still a work in progress is because, yes I have used documenation such as the janitor package page to troubleshoot, but in the end still needed further help solving my issues. I feel that once I am able to pull up packages pages and solve the issue without additional help that this will be an objective that is satisfied(Would love more thoughts or comments regarding this objective). Next objective that is a work in progress currently would be "Write clear, efficient, and well-documented R programs." To some extenet I feel that yes, have written R-programs but its the clear, efficient and well documented part I feel that is not all there. I have been adding comments within my NFL project code with the goal of outling what I want to do in certain sections of code, but it has not alwasy been the most effeicnt in those code chunks with certani code being scattered in different sections. This makes it a little muddy to understand when viewing, my hope is to have everthing clearned up when the project is complete so that everything is in a logical order and makes snese when viewing. here is an example image of the what ai am talking about ![alt text](Chaos.png "title")
  - Finally for the last objective that I feel has not been addressed yet but hope to address later on in the course! It would be "Write R programs for simulations from probability models and randomization-based experiments.". This is something I hope to incoperate into my NFL Project, my idea would be to take a selection of variables and model them to predict a teams expected win-percentage. Or another idea I had thought to do which maybe would be outside the scope of this course would be to input a teams record and then have the code return a probability that they achieve this record based upon the variables there were selected.

## 3. What Else?
- One thing that comes to mind for this section is the size of the dataset I chose for my project. Choosing a data set with 42,000 Rows and 41 Columns, I know is not massive compared to some. I feel the need to mention this though as it is sometimes hard to see the big picture and thing about what to do when so much data is available for me at least. I guess what I am trying to say is I feel like I did not take the easy way out and chose a small dataset to work with for the semester, and the goal of that was to be have something that I can look back on when later in my career and see how I had navaigated my way through a substantial dataset.

# Final Grade Reflection
## 1. What Grade Did You Earn?
- Currently I would say I have met the grade requirements for a "B", with hopes of pushing that towards and "A". (This in my opinion has remained unchanged)
## 2. How Did You Demonstrate That Grade?
1. That grade I believe is currently demonstrated by the completion of 5 of the 5 course objectives.
  - Starting with the first one that have been satisfied. We can look towards the [NFL Project](https://github.com/JADunivan5/STA418_Project/blob/main/NFL_Project.md#reading-in-data) I am working on. Once you click that link you are going to want to look at the first two sections. There you will see the data being read in and then the usage of janitor package mentioned later. This satisfied the objective of **"Import, manage and clean data"**. This is completed in my project the dataset was succesfully imported, managed and cleaned. As well as taken step further by using the janitor package to give variable names cleaner names for better ease of use. 
 
2. Next this also satisfies the **"Create graphical displays and numerical summaries of data for exploratory analysis and presentations."**. One of the first things I attempeted to do was charting the play types by the down they happened on. This is still being refined further but I would say that it does satisfy the requirement. Here is example image of what has been done so far! ![alt text](MidtermImage.png "Title"). 
  - A brief description of what is going on as you can see the greater the size of the dot the more often the plays(listed on the left are all the playtypes) occurred. Example we can see that the number of field goals happening on 4th down is greater than the number on 1st down.

3. The third objective that has been accomplished would be  **"Use source documentation and other resources to troubleshoot and extend R programs."**. The reason I feel this has been satisfied is because, yes I have used documenation such as the janitor package page to troubleshoot, but now I feel that unless it is an extremely technical question I am confident in my ability to use for example "?function" and be able to apply it to my current situation without little issues. A supporting artifact for this would be [Activity 11](https://github.com/JADunivan5/activity11-simulation/blob/main/activity11-simulation.md#creating-function) more specifically from line 130 to 144 the reasion I chose this is because Activity 09 was the intro to functions and this now Activity 11 showing the refined skill and application. This shows the proess of creating the fucntion and then applying it. Based on this I feel this shows the trouble shooting gprocess to get to the point I am at currently. Another example of using resources to troubleshoot was during the boot strappign process. When I was stuck there I found myself going and reading the resource [Modern Dive](https://moderndive.com/7-sampling.html) through reading this I was able to put together most of my bootstrapping function. From there with slight help from my professor the final product can be seen down in objective 5.

4. The 4th objective would be **"Write clear, efficient, and well-documented R programs."** I have been adding comments within my NFL project code with the goal of outling what I want to do in certain sections of code, but it has not always been the most effeicnt in those code chunks with certain code being scattered in different sections. This makes it a little muddy to understand when viewing, my hope is to have everthing cleaned up when the project is complete so that everything is in a logical order and makes sense when viewing. here is an example image of the what I am talking about how there could be muddiness.
  - ![alt text](Chaos.png "title").  
I would like to update this last section based on work that has been done in my NFL project, now we can see that code chunks have comments outlining what they do and are more specific and concise for an overall easier reading experience for the user.This I feel satisfies the objective, unlike the miterm one that had comments all over. I left that one in here to be used as a comparison. Further more the code is efficent and concise I feel I took the most direct path possible for removing variables within that section.
  - ![alt text](Clean.png "title").  
Now why does this satisfy this objective? I believe it satisfies it because it shows the growth from the original attempts at this objective to the final product that is much better.

5. Finally for the last objective that has been satisfied would be **"Write R programs for simulations from probability models and randomization-based experiments."**. This is something that was accomplished within in my [NFL Project](https://github.com/JADunivan5/STA418_Project/blob/main/NFL_Project.md#calculating-league-average-on-each-down). Starting on the section titled "Calculating League Average on each down" we can see the code used to calculate the probability that a team scored a touchdown on a specific down. Then if we go to next section titled "Resampling 1000 Chicago Bears Offenses on 3rd down.", we can see the bootstrapping that was done to replicate our dataset 1000 times specifically on third down, and then compare it to our league average. Overall from the data we can see that the bears scored touchdowns on 2.8% of there third downs while the league average was 5.21%.  

## 3. What Else?
-Overall based on the 5 core objectives being satisfied throughout the course I feel that I have made enough progress to recieve an "A" in the course. I found the course as a whole to be engaging, mentally stimulating/challenging, but overall thoroughly enjoyed every second of it and hope to continue using R in my future carrers

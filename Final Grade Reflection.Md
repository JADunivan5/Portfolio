#Final Grade Reflection
## 1. What Grade Did You Earn?
- Currently I would say I have met the grade so far is a "B", with hopes of pushing that towards and "A"
## 2. How Did You Demonstrate That Grade?
- That grade I believe is currently demonstrated by the completion of 2 of the 5 course objectives, with 2 being a work in progress and 1 hoping to be accomplished later on in the class.
  - Starting with 2 that have been satisfied. We can look towards the NFL Project I am working on. This satisfied the objective of "Import, manage and clean data". This is completed in my project the dataset was succesfull imported, managed and cleaned. As well as taken step further by using the janitor package to give variable names cleaner names for better ease of use. Next this also satisfies the "Create graphical displays and numerical summaries of data for exploratory analysis and presentations.". One of the first things I attempeted to do was charting the play types by the down they happened on. This is still being refined further but I would say that it does satisfy the requirement   
## 3. What Else?
